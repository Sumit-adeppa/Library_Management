 I developed a comprehensive Library Management System designed to streamline and enhance the management of library resources. This project involved the 
creation of a user-friendly application that caters to the needs of both librarians and library patrons. Below are the key features and functionalities of the system: 
1.User Authentication: The system includes secure login and registration functionalities for both librarians and patrons, ensuring that only authorized users can access the 
system. 


2.Book CatLog Management: Librarians can easily add, update, and delete book records in the catalog. The system supports various book details such as title, author, ISBN, genre, and availability status. 


3.Search and Browse: Patrons can search for books using various criteria such as title, author, genre, and ISBN. The system also allows users to browse the catalog and view detailed information about each book. 


4.Borrowing and Returning: The system facilitates the borrowing and returning of books. Patrons can check the availability of books, borrow them, and return them once they are done. The system keeps track of due dates and overdue books. 

5. User Management: Librarians can manage patron accounts, including adding new patrons, updating their information, and viewing their borrowing history.
   
6.Reports and Analytics: The system generates various reports and analytics, such as the most borrowed books, overdue books, and patron activity. This helps librarians make informed decisions about library management. 

7.Responsive Design: The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices, including desktops.
